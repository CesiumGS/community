# Contributor License Agreements (CLA)

Before we can review a pull request in our open source repos, we require a signed Contributor License Agreement. There is a CLA for:

- [individuals](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScU-yvQdcdjCFHkNXwdNeEXx5Qhu45QXuWX_uF5qiLGFSEwlA/viewform) and
- [corporations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYEaWlBl1tQEiegfHMuqnH9VxyfgXGyIw13C2sN7Fj3J3GVA/viewform).

This only needs to be completed once, and enables contributions to all of the projects under the [CesiumGS](https://github.com/CesiumGS) organization. The CLA ensures you retain copyright to your contributions, and provides us the right to use, modify, and redistribute your contributions using the [Apache 2.0 License](../LICENSE.md).

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to [hello@cesium.com](mailto:hello@cesium)!
